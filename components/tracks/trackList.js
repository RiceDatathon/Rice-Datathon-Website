        <h2>Bill.com Challenge</h2>
        <h2>Network Connections</h2>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Bill.com is a platform that connects businesses through payments. 
            These connections create a large network of dense and sparse connections. 
            At Bill.com, we are interested in using this network to help our customers find new businesses to connect to, 
            search our database, and provide recommendations, to name a few. 
            Therefore, to emulate the challenges we face at Bill.com, 
            we have provided a toy dataset that contains information at the entity level as well as 
            the relationships that make up a network. <br></br>

    <h2>Goldman Sachs Challenge</h2>
    <h2>COVID-19 Trends</h2>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    The COVID pandemic has significantly impacted all industry verticals, travel and 
    tourism being one of the most negatively impacted. Some indicators seem to suggest that travel 
    data may be staging a nascent recovery with geographical/regional nuances. A factual data-supported 
    analysis summarized in an executive-level report is expected that would assist in asserting the health 
    of travel and tourism vs pre-pandemic levels by identifying contributing factors and differentiators, and 
    thereby discerning areas of recoveries. The analysis is expected to also identify resilient leader companies 
    in the travel/tourism industry and thereby include with strategy recommendations. These data points are inputs
     to track macro economic developments, and also on decisions around client portfolios.<br></br>

        <h2>Chevron Challenge</h2>
        <h2>Predicting Rate of Penetration (ROP) for New Well Plans</h2>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            The process of drilling new wells, especially offshore, is extremely challenging and costly. 
            After reaching the seabed more than 3,000 feet under water, rigs in the Gulf of Mexico must drill through 
            an additional 20,000 feet of rock. In these extreme environments, where temperatures and pressures 
            far exceed regular drilling conditions, specialized equipment and teams are required. <br></br>
            <br></br>
            These operations can involve hundreds of people and equipment with very high daily drilling costs. 
            Reducing the time it takes to drill by even a few hours per well can result in significant savings 
            for the company and provide a significant competitive advantage as more and more wells are drilled. <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Your task is to use historic drilling data to build a model that can predict the rate of penetration 
            conditional on controllable drilling parameters and/or parameters that are known before the drilling 
            process begins.  This model could then be used as part of the “Drilling Roadmap” development process, 
            where the WOB and RPM (Among other variables) are determined before drilling begins. <br></br>

        <h2>Cognite Challenge</h2>
        <h2>Weather Analysis</h2>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        National Data Buoy Center (https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/) stores meteorological data from various stations in the oceans. 
        These stations are in strategic locations close to offshore oil and gas platforms and the data obtained 
        from these stations are extremely important to understand the various conditions an offshore platform experiences. 
        In this challenge you will build an interactive dashboard where you will enter the name of the station and 
        will be able to retrieve the wind speed and wind direction at that station for the past 45 days. <br></br>

        <h2>BakerRipley Challenge</h2>
        <h2>Redistrict Houston City's Council</h2>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        As of 2020, there are 2,304,580 Houstonians, who are represented by 16 city council members. 
        Eleven are elected by voters within single-member districts and five at-large members are elected 
        by all city voters. Prior to the 2023 election, the City of Houston will redraw the district maps based 
        on the population changes that occurred between the 2010 and 2020 census. Since the 2010 census, 
        the population of the City of Houston has grown by 205,129 people, a 9.8% increase.<br></br>
        <br></br>
        Your challenge is to create a redistricting map for the City of Houston based on
        the 2020 census and changes in population since 2010. Your map can maintain the
        status-quo of 11 single-member districts or you may choose to increase or decrease the
        number of districts if needed to fulfill an equitable balance of power. <br></br>

    <h2>Beginner's Challenge</h2>
    <h2>Game of Loans: Home Purchases in Harris County, TX</h2>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, "The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) 
        requires many financial institutions to maintain, report, and publicly disclose loan-level information 
        about mortgages. These data help show whether lenders are serving the housing needs of their communities; 
        they give public officials information that helps them make decisions and policies; and they shed light on 
        lending patterns that could be discriminatory." For this challenge, participants will be asked to make use 
        of mortgage application data made available via the HMDA to construct a data science project of their own. 
        This project may involve building a model to predict mortgage application approval, predict the level of 
        interest for a given mortgage, identify potentially discriminatory lending patterns, or carry out an 
        entirely separate analysis. <br></br>
