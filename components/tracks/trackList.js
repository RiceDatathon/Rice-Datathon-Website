        <h2>Network Connections</h2>
        {/* <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Bill.com is a platform that connects businesses through payments. 
            These connections create a large network of dense and sparse connections. 
            At Bill.com, we are interested in using this network to help our customers find new businesses to connect to, 
            search our database, and provide recommendations, to name a few. 
            Therefore, to emulate the challenges we face at Bill.com, 
            we have provided a toy dataset that contains information at the entity level as well as 
            the relationships that make up a network. <br></br>
            <br></br>

        <h2>Chevron Challenge</h2>
        <h2>Oil Drilling Modelling</h2>
            {/* <h3>Background</h3>
            The process of drilling new wells, especially offshore, is extremely challenging and costly. 
            After reaching the seabed more than 3,000 feet under water, rigs in the Gulf of Mexico must drill through 
            an additional 20,000 feet of rock. In these extreme environments, where temperatures and pressures 
            far exceed regular drilling conditions, specialized equipment and teams are required. <br></br>
            <br></br>
            These operations can involve hundreds of people and equipment with very high daily drilling costs. 
            Reducing the time it takes to drill by even a few hours per well can result in significant savings 
            for the company and provide a significant competitive advantage as more and more wells are drilled. <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Your task is to use historic drilling data to build a model that can predict the rate of penetration 
            conditional on controllable drilling parameters and/or parameters that are known before the drilling 
            process begins.  This model could then be used as part of the “Drilling Roadmap” development process, 
            where the WOB and RPM (Among other variables) are determined before drilling begins. <br></br>

        <h2>Cognite Challenge</h2>
        <h2>Weather Analysis</h2>
        {/* <h3>Background</h3>
        National Data Buoy Center (https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/) stores meteorological data from various stations in the oceans. 
        These stations are in strategic locations close to offshore oil and gas platforms and the data obtained 
        from these stations are extremely important to understand the various conditions an offshore platform experiences. 
        In this challenge you will build an interactive dashboard where you will enter the name of the station and 
        will be able to retrieve the wind speed and wind direction at that station for the past 45 days. <br></br>

        <h2>BakerRipley Challenge</h2>
        <h2>Houston City Council Investigation</h2>
        {/* <h3>Background</h3>
        As of 2020, there are 2,304,580 Houstonians, who are represented by 16 city council members. 
        Eleven are elected by voters within single-member districts and five at-large members are elected 
        by all city voters. Prior to the 2023 election, the City of Houston will redraw the district maps based 
        on the population changes that occurred between the 2010 and 2020 census. Since the 2010 census, 
        the population of the City of Houston has grown by 205,129 people, a 9.8% increase.<br></br>
        <br></br>
        Your challenge is to create a redistricting map for the City of Houston based on
        the 2020 census and changes in population since 2010. Your map can maintain the
        status-quo of 11 single-member districts or you may choose to increase or decrease the
        number of districts if needed to fulfill an equitable balance of power. <br></br>

    <h2>Beginner's Challenge</h2>
    <h2>Loan Analysis</h2>
    {/* <p>As a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a global shift towards remote business operations. The medical field is no different, as the shift towards telemedicine was heavily accelerated by the pandemic. Data from the CDC shows that there was a 154% YoY increase in telemedicine visits during March 2020 compared to the same period in 2019<sup><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6943a3.htm">1</a></sup>.
        By summer 2020, however, there was a sharp decline in telemedicine appointments as patients opted to return to in-office appointments<sup><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/09/01/telehealth-visits-decline-covid19-hospitals/">2</a></sup>. This This distinct change in behavior brings into question what the future of telemedicine will look like.</p>
    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>Using the corpus of publications provided and any supplemental datasets of interest, identify key areas of concern or opportunity for the telemedicine industry. A successful project will be able to synthesize the results of analysis on the provided dataset in the context of the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic. Feel free to incorporate any supplemental datasets of interest.</p>
