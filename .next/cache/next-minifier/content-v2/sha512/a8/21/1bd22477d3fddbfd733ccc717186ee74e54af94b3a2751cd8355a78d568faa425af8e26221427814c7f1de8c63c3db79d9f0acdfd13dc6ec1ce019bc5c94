After reaching the seabed more than 3,000 feet under water, rigs in the Gulf of Mexico must drill through an additional 20,000 feet of rock. In these extreme environments, where temperatures and pressures far exceed regular drilling conditions, specialized equipment and teams are required. These operations can involve hundreds of people and equipment with very high daily drilling costs. Reducing the time it takes to drill by even a few hours per well can result in significant savings for the company and provide a significant competitive advantage as more and more wells are drilled. Your task is to use historic drilling data to build a model that can predict the rate of penetration conditional on controllable drilling parameters and/or parameters that are known before the drilling process begins.  This model could then be used as part of the \\u201cDrilling Roadmap\\u201d development process, where the WOB and RPM (Among other variables) are determined before drilling begins.\"),d(\"h4\",null,\"Download the rest of the information and the data here:\"),d(\"a\",{href:\"../../static/chevronChallenge.zip\"},\"Chevron Challenge Zip File\"),d(\"p\",null),d(\"a\",{href:\"../../static/scoring.csv\"},\"Scoring.csv File\")),d(\"div\",null,d(\"h2\",null,\"Predicting the Severity of Forest Fires Applied Machine Learning for Social Good Sponsored by Accenture\"),d(\"h3\",null,\"Background\"),d(\"p\",null,\"Forest fires are a serious natural disaster experienced by countries around the world.

The following core data elements were required for records to be included in this data publication: discovery date, final fire size, and a point location at least as precise as Public Land Survey System (PLSS) section (1-square mile grid). The data were transformed to conform, when possible, to the data standards of the National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG). Basic error-checking was performed and redundant records were identified and removed, to the degree possible.
