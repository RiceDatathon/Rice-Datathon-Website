In practice, especially in large industry projects, the modeling portion is generally only a small portion of the overall effort in serving a production-grade machine learning system.  To reflect that, we’re dedicating this track specifically for building tools for machine learning, fusing datasets, or interesting applications related to data science but not modeling per se.</p>\r\n        <h3>Objective</h3>\r\n        <p>The outcome of this track is highly dependent on what part of the data science pipeline you’re wishing to contribute.  Here are some project suggestions to give you an idea of what might fall under this track!</p>\r\n        <ul>\r\n            <li>Data Engineering/Scraping Project Suggestions\r\n                <ul>\r\n                    <li>Combining related datasets in an interesting/useful way</li>\r\n                    <li>Ex: Collecting data tied to different US States to develop an API for easily accessing and comparing information</li>\r\n                </ul>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>ML Tools\r\n                <ul>\r\n                    <li>WYSIWIG Neural Network Application</li>\r\n                    <li>Web application that lets you create drag n drop neural networks</li>\r\n                </ul>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>Data Visualization Tools\r\n                <ul>\r\n                    <li>Automatic Data Summarization - Auto-generate summaries and visualizations of arbitrary CSV files</li>\r\n                    <li>Cloropleth Plotting Toolkit - Matplotlib / Altair / Geopandas have great utilities for this, but I always have to refer to documentation because I forget!

These projects should draft a narrative about a trend observed from a local dataset.</p>\r\n        <h3>Objective</h3>\r\n        <p>The outcome of this track is a presentation that paints a coherent story with supporting figures from Houston / Texas related datasets.  Great projects might extend this presentation to include a simple policy suggestion to the Houston City Government or Texas State Government.</p>\r\n        <h3>Kinder UDP</h3>\r\n        <p>The Kinder Urban Data Platform has a wealth of data collected and maintained by the Kinder Institute.
