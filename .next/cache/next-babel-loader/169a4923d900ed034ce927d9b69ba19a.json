It is the third update of a publication originally generated to support the national Fire Program Analysis (FPA) system. The wildfire records were acquired from the reporting systems of federal, state, and local fire organizations. The following core data elements were required for records to be included in this data publication: discovery date, final fire size, and a point location at least as precise as Public Land Survey System (PLSS) section (1-square mile grid). The data were transformed to conform, when possible, to the data standards of the National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG). Basic error-checking was performed and redundant records were identified and removed, to the degree possible. The resulting product, referred to as the Fire Program Analysis Fire-occurrence Database (FPA FOD), includes 1.88 million geo-referenced wildfire records, representing a total of 140 million acres burned during the 24-year period.</p>*/}\n        {/*<h3>Source</h3>*/}\n        {/*<p>https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires/kernels</p>*/}\n    </div>,\n    <div>\n        {/*<h2>Machine Learning Systems Track</h2>*/}\n        {/*<h3>Background</h3>*/}\n        {/*<p>This track is designed for students who may not have an extensive background in modeling but are experienced programmers who are looking to get involved with data science.
