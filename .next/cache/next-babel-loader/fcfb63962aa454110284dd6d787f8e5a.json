It would be great if I could pass a dataframe with “state, numeric feature” to a function to get a quick plot.</li>\r\n                    <li>Complex Data Visualization to React Component - Can you make it easier to turn a complex & potentially live visualization into a component for a web frontend to consume?</li>\r\n                </ul>\r\n            </li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n    </div>,\r\n    <div>\r\n        <h2>Houston/Texas Trends Track</h2>\r\n        <h3>Background</h3>\r\n        <p>This track is designed for students who are specifically interested in working with a Houston or Texas related dataset.  These projects should draft a narrative about a trend observed from a local dataset.</p>\r\n        <h3>Objective</h3>\r\n        <p>The outcome of this track is a presentation that paints a coherent story with supporting figures from Houston / Texas related datasets.  Great projects might extend this presentation to include a simple policy suggestion to the Houston City Government or Texas State Government.</p>\r\n        <h3>Kinder UDP</h3>\r\n        <p>The Kinder Urban Data Platform has a wealth of data collected and maintained by the Kinder Institute.
