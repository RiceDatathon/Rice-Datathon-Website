In this Data Science Challenge, you are tasked with developing a model to predict:\n//             The Gross Sold quantity of hot dogs for different days and buckets for some stores. Please keep in mind that your model must predict an integer number of hotdogs to be sold, there is no such thing as 7.5 hot dogs.\n//         </p>\n//         <h4>Download the rest of the information and the data here:</h4>\n//         <a href=\"../../static/tracks/Chevron_2021_Datathon_Challenge.zip\">Chevron Challenge Zip File</a>\n//         {/*<p></p>*/}\n//         {/*<a href=\"../../static/scoring.csv\">Scoring.csv File</a>*/}\n//     </div>,\n//     <div>\n//         <h2>Quantlab Challenge</h2>\n//         <h3>Background</h3>\n//         <p>In the last 3 months of 2020, Bitcoin (BTC) saw significant volatility as the price climbed from about $10,000 to nearly $30,000. A simple buy and hold strategy in this period would yield phenomenal USD returns but would see no growth in total BTC held.</p>\n//         <h3>Objective</h3>\n//         <p>The goal of this challenge is to develop a trading strategy to exploit market volatility to maximize the amount of BTC held in a given period.

The medical field is no different, as the shift towards telemedicine was heavily accelerated by the pandemic. Data from the CDC shows that there was a 154% YoY increase in telemedicine visits during March 2020 compared to the same period in 2019<sup><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6943a3.htm\">1</a></sup>.\n//             By summer 2020, however, there was a sharp decline in telemedicine appointments as patients opted to return to in-office appointments<sup><a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/09/01/telehealth-visits-decline-covid19-hospitals/\">2</a></sup>. This This distinct change in behavior brings into question what the future of telemedicine will look like.</p>\n//         <h3>Objective</h3>\n//         <p>Using the corpus of publications provided and any supplemental datasets of interest, identify key areas of concern or opportunity for the telemedicine industry.
