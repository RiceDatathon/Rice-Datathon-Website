garbage by Fuel Station Managers due to sanitary restrictions on how much time they are kept warm.\n            Having a robust cook plan for every day would grant the stores a sales forecast and a money saving tool.\n            During this challenge, the participants are requested to create a cook plan for certain buckets of time.\n            Stores are open from 8 am to 8 pm every day, including weekends.\n            The 3-hour time buckets provided are:\n            1 = 8am to 10 am,\n            2 = 11am to 1 pm,\n            3 = 2pm to 4 pm,\n            4 = 5pm to 8 pm.\n            <h3>Objective</h3>\n            When planning the logistics of the store, the store managers need to know with time in advance how many hot dogs are they going to sell during that month. In this Data Science Challenge, you are tasked with developing a model to predict:\n            The Gross Sold quantity of hot dogs for different days and buckets for some stores. Please keep in mind that your model must predict an integer number of hotdogs to be sold, there is no such thing as 7.5 hot dogs.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Download the rest of the information and the data here:</h4>\n        <a href=\"../../static/tracks/Chevron 2021 Datathon Challenge.zip\">Chevron Challenge Zip File</a>\n        {/*<p></p>*/}\n        {/*<a href=\"../../static/scoring.csv\">Scoring.csv File</a>*/}\n    </div>,\n    <div>\n        <h2>Predicting the Severity of Forest Fires Applied Machine Learning for Social Good Sponsored by Accenture</h2>\n        <h3>Background</h3>\n        <p>Forest fires are a serious natural disaster experienced by countries around the world. Recently, forest fires in Australia and California have engulfed huge swaths of habitat causing untold loss to local communities, wildlife, and ecosystems. Forest fires across the globe are responsible for killing thousands per year and costing billions of dollars. <a href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.1215.pdf\">Read More</a></p>\n        <h3>Objective</h3>\n        <p>Your goal is to develop a model that predicts the severity of a wildfire based on the expected area it will engulf using the fire’s initial conditions. You then need to create a plan for how your model should be used by firefighters or other governmental entities to combat this issue more intelligently and effectively. Included in your plan, you should take a step back from the numbers and discuss realistic data accessibility, whether the key factors found in your model make sense, and whether you would trust your model in this high-stakes situation. </p>\n        <h3>Dataset Description</h3>\n        <p>You are free to use any dataset you find online that assists you in answering the overall question.

It is the third update of a publication originally generated to support the national Fire Program Analysis (FPA) system. The wildfire records were acquired from the reporting systems of federal, state, and local fire organizations. The following core data elements were required for records to be included in this data publication: discovery date, final fire size, and a point location at least as precise as Public Land Survey System (PLSS) section (1-square mile grid). The data were transformed to conform, when possible, to the data standards of the National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG). Basic error-checking was performed and redundant records were identified and removed, to the degree possible. The resulting product, referred to as the Fire Program Analysis Fire-occurrence Database (FPA FOD), includes 1.88 million geo-referenced wildfire records, representing a total of 140 million acres burned during the 24-year period.</p>\n        <h3>Source</h3>\n        <p>https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires/kernels</p>\n    </div>,\n    <div>\n        <h2>Machine Learning Systems Track</h2>\n        <h3>Background</h3>\n        <p>This track is designed for students who may not have an extensive background in modeling but are experienced programmers who are looking to get involved with data science.
