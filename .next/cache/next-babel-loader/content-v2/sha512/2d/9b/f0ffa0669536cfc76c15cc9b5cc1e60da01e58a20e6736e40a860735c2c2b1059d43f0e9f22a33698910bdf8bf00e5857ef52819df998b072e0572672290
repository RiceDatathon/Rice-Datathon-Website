This model could then be used as part of the “Drilling Roadmap” development process, \n            where the WOB and RPM (Among other variables) are determined before drilling begins. <br></br>\n            <br></br>\n            For more details about Chevron's challenge, click <a href=\"static/tracks2022/Chevron Challenge/Chevron 2022 Datathon Challenge Synopsis.docx\">here</a>\n        <h3>Dataset</h3>\n        <a href=\"static/tracks2022/Chevron Challenge/chevron_challenge_initial.zip\">Chevron Challenge Zip File</a>\n        {/* <a href=\"static/tracks2022/Chevron Challenge/chevron_scoring.zip\">Chevron Scoring Zip File</a> */}\n    </div>,\n    <div>\n        <h2>Cognite Challenge</h2>\n        <h2>Weather Analysis</h2>\n        <h3>Background</h3>\n        National Data Buoy Center (https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/) stores meteorological data from various stations in the oceans. \n        These stations are in strategic locations close to offshore oil and gas platforms and the data obtained \n        from these stations are extremely important to understand the various conditions an offshore platform experiences. \n        In this challenge you will build an interactive dashboard where you will enter the name of the station and \n        will be able to retrieve the wind speed and wind direction at that station for the past 45 days. <br></br>\n        <br></br>\n        For more details about Cognite's Challenge (including data sources), click <a href=\"static/tracks2022/Cognite Challenge/Rice_Datathon_Cognite_Track.docx\">here</a>\n    </div>,\n    <div>\n        <h2>BakerRipley Challenge</h2>\n        <h2>Redistrict Houston City's Council</h2>\n        <h3>Background</h3>\n        As of 2020, there are 2,304,580 Houstonians, who are represented by 16 city council members. \n        Eleven are elected by voters within single-member districts and five at-large members are elected \n        by all city voters.
