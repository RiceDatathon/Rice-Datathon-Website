In these extreme environments, where temperatures and pressures \n            far exceed regular drilling conditions, specialized equipment and teams are required. <br></br>\n            <br></br>\n            These operations can involve hundreds of people and equipment with very high daily drilling costs. \n            Reducing the time it takes to drill by even a few hours per well can result in significant savings \n            for the company and provide a significant competitive advantage as more and more wells are drilled. <br></br>\n            <br></br>\n            Your task is to use historic drilling data to build a model that can predict the rate of penetration \n            conditional on controllable drilling parameters and/or parameters that are known before the drilling \n            process begins.  This model could then be used as part of the “Drilling Roadmap” development process, \n            where the WOB and RPM (Among other variables) are determined before drilling begins. <br></br>\n            <br></br>\n            For more details about Chevron's challenge, click <a href=\"static/tracks2022/Chevron Challenge/Chevron 2022 Datathon Challenge Synopsis.docx\">here</a>\n        <h3>Dataset</h3>\n        <a href=\"static/tracks2022/Chevron Challenge/chevron_challenge_initial.zip\">Chevron Challenge Zip File</a>\n        {/* <a href=\"static/tracks2022/Chevron Challenge/chevron_scoring.zip\">Chevron Scoring Zip File</a> */}\n    </div>,\n    <div>\n        <h2>Cognite Challenge</h2>\n        <h2>Weather Analysis</h2>\n        <h3>Background</h3>\n        National Data Buoy Center (https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/) stores meteorological data from various stations in the oceans. \n        These stations are in strategic locations close to offshore oil and gas platforms and the data obtained \n        from these stations are extremely important to understand the various conditions an offshore platform experiences. \n        In this challenge you will build an interactive dashboard where you will enter the name of the station and \n        will be able to retrieve the wind speed and wind direction at that station for the past 45 days. <br></br>\n        <br></br>\n        For more details about Cognite's Challenge (including data sources), click <a href=\"static/tracks2022/Cognite Challenge/Rice_Datathon_Cognite_Track.docx\">here</a>\n    </div>,\n    <div>\n        <h2>BakerRipley Challenge</h2>\n        <h2>Houston City Council Investigation</h2>\n        <h3>Background</h3>\n        As of 2020, there are 2,304,580 Houstonians, who are represented by 16 city council members. \n        Eleven are elected by voters within single-member districts and five at-large members are elected \n        by all city voters.
