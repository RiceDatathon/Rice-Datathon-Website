The medical field is no different, as the shift towards telemedicine was heavily accelerated by the pandemic. Data from the CDC shows that there was a 154% YoY increase in telemedicine visits during March 2020 compared to the same period in 2019.\n            By summer 2020, however, there was a sharp decline in telemedicine appointments as patients opted to return to in-office appointments. <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/09/01/telehealth-visits-decline-covid19-hospitals/\">2</a> This distinct change in behavior brings into question what the future of telemedicine will look like.</p>\n        <h3>Objective</h3>\n        <p>Using the corpus of publications provided and any supplemental datasets of interest, identify key areas of concern or opportunity for the telemedicine industry. A successful project will be able to synthesize the results of analysis on the provided dataset in the context of the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic.
