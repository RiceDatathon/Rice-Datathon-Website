The following core data elements were required for records to be included in this data publication: discovery date, final fire size, and a point location at least as precise as Public Land Survey System (PLSS) section (1-square mile grid). The data were transformed to conform, when possible, to the data standards of the National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG). Basic error-checking was performed and redundant records were identified and removed, to the degree possible.

It is the third update of a publication originally generated to support the national Fire Program Analysis (FPA) system. The wildfire records were acquired from the reporting systems of federal, state, and local fire organizations. The following core data elements were required for records to be included in this data publication: discovery date, final fire size, and a point location at least as precise as Public Land Survey System (PLSS) section (1-square mile grid). The data were transformed to conform, when possible, to the data standards of the National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG). Basic error-checking was performed and redundant records were identified and removed, to the degree possible. The resulting product, referred to as the Fire Program Analysis Fire-occurrence Database (FPA FOD), includes 1.88 million geo-referenced wildfire records, representing a total of 140 million acres burned during the 24-year period.</p>\n        <h3>Source</h3>\n        <p>https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires/kernels</p>\n    </div>,\n    <div>\n        <h2>Chevron Challenge</h2>\n        <p>\n            <h3>Background</h3>\n            Every year thousands of hot dogs are toss into the garbage by Fuel Station Managers due to sanitary restrictions on how much time they are kept warm.\n            Having a robust cook plan for every day would grant the stores a sales forecast and a money saving tool.\n            During this challenge, the participants are requested to create a cook plan for certain buckets of time.\n            Stores are open from 8 am to 8 pm every day, including weekends.\n            The 3-hour time buckets provided are:\n            1 = 8am to 10 am,\n            2 = 11am to 1 pm,\n            3 = 2pm to 4 pm,\n            4 = 5pm to 8 pm.\n            <h3>Objective</h3>\n            When planning the logistics of the store, the store managers need to know with time in advance how many hot dogs are they going to sell during that month.
