After reaching the seabed more than 3,000 feet under water, rigs in the Gulf of Mexico must drill through an additional 20,000 feet of rock. In these extreme environments, where temperatures and pressures far exceed regular drilling conditions, specialized equipment and teams are required. These operations can involve hundreds of people and equipment with very high daily drilling costs. Reducing the time it takes to drill by even a few hours per well can result in significant savings for the company and provide a significant competitive advantage as more and more wells are drilled. Your task is to use historic drilling data to build a model that can predict the rate of penetration conditional on controllable drilling parameters and/or parameters that are known before the drilling process begins.  This model could then be used as part of the \\u201CDrilling Roadmap\\u201D development process, where the WOB and RPM (Among other variables) are determined before drilling begins.\"), __jsx(\"h4\", {\n  __self: this,\n  __source: {\n    fileName: _jsxFileName,\n    lineNumber: 9,\n    columnNumber: 9\n  }\n}, \"Download the rest of the information and the data here:\"), __jsx(\"a\", {\n  href: \"../../static/chevronChallenge.zip\",\n  __self: this,\n  __source: {\n    fileName: _jsxFileName,\n    lineNumber: 10,\n    columnNumber: 9\n  }\n}, \"Chevron Challenge Zip File\"), __jsx(\"p\", {\n  __self: this,\n  __source: {\n    fileName: _jsxFileName,\n    lineNumber: 11,\n    columnNumber: 9\n  }\n}), __jsx(\"a\", {\n  href: \"../../static/scoring.csv\",\n  __self: this,\n  __source: {\n    fileName: _jsxFileName,\n    lineNumber: 12,\n    columnNumber: 9\n  }\n}, \"Scoring.csv File\")), __jsx(\"div\", {\n  __self: this,\n  __source: {\n    fileName: _jsxFileName,\n    lineNumber: 14,\n    columnNumber: 5\n  }\n}, __jsx(\"h2\", {\n  __self: this,\n  __source: {\n    fileName: _jsxFileName,\n    lineNumber: 15,\n    columnNumber: 9\n  }\n}, \"Predicting the Severity of Forest Fires Applied Machine Learning for Social Good Sponsored by Accenture\"), __jsx(\"h3\", {\n  __self: this,\n  __source: {\n    fileName: _jsxFileName,\n    lineNumber: 16,\n    columnNumber: 9\n  }\n}, \"Background\"), __jsx(\"p\", {\n  __self: this,\n  __source: {\n    fileName: _jsxFileName,\n    lineNumber: 17,\n    columnNumber: 9\n  }\n}, \"Forest fires are a serious natural disaster experienced by countries around the world.

After reaching the seabed more than 3,000 feet under water, rigs in the Gulf of Mexico must drill through an additional 20,000 feet of rock. In these extreme environments, where temperatures and pressures far exceed regular drilling conditions, specialized equipment and teams are required.\n             These operations can involve hundreds of people and equipment with very high daily drilling costs. Reducing the time it takes to drill by even a few hours per well can result in significant savings for the company and provide a significant competitive advantage as more and more wells are drilled.\n             Your task is to use historic drilling data to build a model that can predict the rate of penetration conditional on controllable drilling parameters and/or parameters that are known before the drilling process begins.  This model could then be used as part of the “Drilling Roadmap” development process, where the WOB and RPM (Among other variables) are determined before drilling begins.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Download the rest of the information and the data here:</h4>\n        <a href=\"../../static/chevronChallenge.zip\">Chevron Challenge Zip File</a>\n        <p></p>\n        <a href=\"../../static/scoring.csv\">Scoring.csv File</a>\n    </div>,\n    <div>\n        <h2>Predicting the Severity of Forest Fires Applied Machine Learning for Social Good Sponsored by Accenture</h2>\n        <h3>Background</h3>\n        <p>Forest fires are a serious natural disaster experienced by countries around the world. Recently, forest fires in Australia and California have engulfed huge swaths of habitat causing untold loss to local communities, wildlife, and ecosystems. Forest fires across the globe are responsible for killing thousands per year and costing billions of dollars. <a href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.1215.pdf\">Read More</a></p>\n        <h3>Objective</h3>\n        <p>Your goal is to develop a model that predicts the severity of a wildfire based on the expected area it will engulf using the fire’s initial conditions. You then need to create a plan for how your model should be used by firefighters or other governmental entities to combat this issue more intelligently and effectively. Included in your plan, you should take a step back from the numbers and discuss realistic data accessibility, whether the key factors found in your model make sense, and whether you would trust your model in this high-stakes situation. </p>\n        <h3>Dataset Description</h3>\n        <p>You are free to use any dataset you find online that assists you in answering the overall question.

It is the third update of a publication originally generated to support the national Fire Program Analysis (FPA) system. The wildfire records were acquired from the reporting systems of federal, state, and local fire organizations. The following core data elements were required for records to be included in this data publication: discovery date, final fire size, and a point location at least as precise as Public Land Survey System (PLSS) section (1-square mile grid). The data were transformed to conform, when possible, to the data standards of the National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG). Basic error-checking was performed and redundant records were identified and removed, to the degree possible. The resulting product, referred to as the Fire Program Analysis Fire-occurrence Database (FPA FOD), includes 1.88 million geo-referenced wildfire records, representing a total of 140 million acres burned during the 24-year period.</p>\n        <h3>Source</h3>\n        <p>https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires/kernels</p>\n    </div>,\n    <div>\n        <h2>Machine Learning Systems Track</h2>\n        <h3>Background</h3>\n        <p>This track is designed for students who may not have an extensive background in modeling but are experienced programmers who are looking to get involved with data science.
