After reaching the seabed more than 3,000 feet under water, rigs in the Gulf of Mexico must drill through an additional 20,000 feet of rock. In these extreme environments, where temperatures and pressures far exceed regular drilling conditions, specialized equipment and teams are required. These operations can involve hundreds of people and equipment with very high daily drilling costs. Reducing the time it takes to drill by even a few hours per well can result in significant savings for the company and provide a significant competitive advantage as more and more wells are drilled. Your task is to use historic drilling data to build a model that can predict the rate of penetration conditional on controllable drilling parameters and/or parameters that are known before the drilling process begins.
