In these extreme environments, where temperatures and pressures far exceed regular drilling conditions, specialized equipment and teams are required. These operations can involve hundreds of people and equipment with very high daily drilling costs. Reducing the time it takes to drill by even a few hours per well can result in significant savings for the company and provide a significant competitive advantage as more and more wells are drilled.
