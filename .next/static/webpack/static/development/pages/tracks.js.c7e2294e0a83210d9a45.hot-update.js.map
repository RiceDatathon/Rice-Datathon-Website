Recently, forest fires in Australia and California have engulfed huge swaths of habitat causing untold loss to local communities, wildlife, and ecosystems. Forest fires across the globe are responsible for killing thousands per year and costing billions of dollars. <a href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.1215.pdf\">(https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.1215.pdf)</a></p>>\r\n        <h3>Objective</h3>\r\n        <p>Your goal is to develop a model that predicts the severity of a wildfire based on the expected area it will engulf using the fire’s initial conditions. You then need to create a plan for how your model should be used by firefighters or other governmental entities to combat this issue more intelligently and effectively. Included in your plan, you should take a step back from the numbers and discuss realistic data accessibility, whether the key factors found in your model make sense, and whether you would trust your model in this high-stakes situation. </p>\r\n        <h3>Dataset Description</h3>\r\n        <p>You are free to use any dataset you find online that assists you in answering the overall question. We have provided an initial data set to help you get started. </p>\r\n        <h3>Kaggle Forest Fire Dataset</h3>\r\n        <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires\">https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires</a>\r\n        <p>This data publication contains a spatial database of wildfires that occurred in the United States from 1992 to 2015. It is the third update of a publication originally generated to support the national Fire Program Analysis (FPA) system. The wildfire records were acquired from the reporting systems of federal, state, and local fire organizations. The following core data elements were required for records to be included in this data publication: discovery date, final fire size, and a point location at least as precise as Public Land Survey System (PLSS) section (1-square mile grid). The data were transformed to conform, when possible, to the data standards of the National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG). Basic error-checking was performed and redundant records were identified and removed, to the degree possible. The resulting product, referred to as the Fire Program Analysis Fire-occurrence Database (FPA FOD), includes 1.88 million geo-referenced wildfire records, representing a total of 140 million acres burned during the 24-year period.</p>\r\n        <h3>Source</h3>\r\n        <p>https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires/kernels</p>\r\n    </div>,\r\n    <div>\r\n        <h2>Machine Learning Systems Track</h2>\r\n        <h3>Background</h3>\r\n\r\n    </div>,\r\n    <div>\r\n\r\n    </div>,\r\n    <div>\r\n        <h2>College/University Survey Data</h2>\r\n        <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/DataFiles.aspx\">Get the Dataset Here</a>\r\n        <p>\r\n            The datasets available from this search tool offer a wide variety of data ranging from institutional characteristics of colleges, to their test scores and graduation rates.
